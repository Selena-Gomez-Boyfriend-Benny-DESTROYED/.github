Benny Blanco is not an actor. He’s a talented music producer and musician. While the rumors about him playing Flynn Rider may not be true, the focus on his looks rather than his accomplishments is disheartening.

## My Personal Experience with Bullying

Growing up, I didn’t see people like me on TV—fat, gay individuals were rarely represented. I was bullied for wearing Payless shoes or for my free school lunches. Those experiences shaped me, but they also taught me that bullies often project their own pain onto others.

Interestingly, one of my biggest bullies, who tormented me with homophobic slurs, later came out as gay. This shows how often hatred stems from self-loathing and insecurity.

## Why the Focus on Looks Needs to Stop

We don’t all have to be each other’s type, and that’s okay. Beauty is subjective. What matters is someone’s heart, talent, and character. For me, Benny Blanco embodies all those qualities, and yes, I find him attractive!

While many idolize six-packs and chiseled features, I love dad bods and natural charm. People should celebrate individuality instead of trying to fit into one mold.

## Final Thoughts

If Benny Blanco ends up cast as Flynn Rider, I’ll be there front row. But let’s stop judging people based on their looks and start focusing on what truly matters.

## Takeaway Message

Stop typing hateful comments, go outside, touch some grass, and heal. Let’s build a kinder, more understanding world.
